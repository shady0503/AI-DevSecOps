Utilize vulnerability scanning and package version checks.\n2.  **Apply Patch (Due: Day 60):** Apply the fix to identified systems (if available) according to vendor guidance. Use version 10.1.45 or later.\n3.  **No Patch? Plan B (Due: Day 60):** If no patch is available or effective, implement alternative mitigations (e.g., network segmentation, access restrictions, monitoring) based on risk assessment.\n4.  **Review NIST CSWP 29:** Consult NIST CSWP 29 contact for guidance on cascading risk decisions.\n\n**Verification:**\n1.  **System Owner Confirmation:** System owners confirm completion of remediation/alternative measures for all identified systems.\n2.  **Security Testing (Optional but Recommended):** Verify patched systems are free from the vulnerability (consider cost/benefit).

Monitor AWS security logs (e.g., CloudTrail) for any attempts to modify subnet configurations or assign public IPs (if access control logs are enabled).\n4.  Periodic audits by the CISO or designated security personnel to confirm adherence.",
  "yaml.docker-compose.security.no-new-privileges.no-new-privileges": "Okay, here is the security policy based on the provided vulnerability and guidance:\n\n**Title:** MEDIUM - yaml.docker-compose.security.no-new-privileges\n\n**Scope:** This policy applies to all systems using Docker Compose files (docker-compose.yml) and associated command-line interfaces, particularly those handling sensitive workloads or data.\n\n**Risk:** Improperly configured Docker Compose files or commands could allow users with limited privileges to escalate their access, potentially gaining unauthorized elevated privileges or accessing restricted system resources, compromising system integrity and confidentiality.\n\n**Controls:**\n*   Implement the principle of least privilege (NIST SP 800-53 AC-2, ISO 27001:2022 A.9.2.3).\n*   Enforce strict access controls on Docker Compose files and execution (NIST SP 800-53 AA-25, ISO 27001:2022 A.5.5).\n*   Ensure segregation of duties where necessary for Docker Compose management (NIST SP 800-53 PR.AA-06).\n\n**Remediation:** Immediately implement least privilege for Docker Compose execution. Restrict access to Docker Compose files and executables based on user roles. Define and enforce duties separation for compose file creation/modification and execution. Review existing Docker configurations and user permissions.\n\n**Verification:** Regularly audit Docker Compose file permissions and access logs. Conduct periodic reviews of user privileges and segregation of duties policies related to Docker. Track any security incidents potentially linked to Docker misconfigurations.",
  "yaml.docker-compose.security.writable-filesystem-service.writable-filesystem-service": "Okay, here is a security policy addressing the identified vulnerability, using the requested structure and incorporating NIST CSF 2.0 and ISO 27001:2022 guidance.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** MEDIUM - yaml.docker-compose.security.writable-filesystem-service.writable-filesystem-service\n\n**Scope:** All systems running Docker Compose (including development, staging, and production environments) where sensitive data or critical system files might be affected.\n\n**Risk:** Improperly configured Docker Compose services with write access to the host filesystem can lead to unauthorized modification or exposure of sensitive data, potential privilege escalation, or disruption of services. This configuration increases the attack surface.\n\n**Controls:**\n*   **NIST CSF 2.0:** PR.AT-06 (Access Control for Privileged Accounts), PR.AT-01 (Controlled Access to Information/System Processes)\n*   **ISO 27001:2022 Annex A:** A.9.2.3 (Privileged Access Rights), A.8.5 (Secure Authentication), A.8.3 (Access Control)\n\n**Remediation:**\n1.  Immediately update all affected Docker Compose configurations to use `:ro` (read-only) for volumes where read access is granted. Restrict write access unless absolutely necessary.\n2.  For services requiring write access, use named volumes or bind mounts with specific permissions carefully, ensuring minimal necessary access.\n3.  Implement a policy review cycle (e.g., quarterly) for all Docker Compose configurations to ensure adherence to secure defaults.\n4.  Restrict user permissions on the host system to prevent users with write access to relevant directories.\n\nTimeline: Remediation and policy implementation to be completed within 1 week; subsequent reviews every quarter.\n\n**Verification:**\n1.  Automated security scanning tools (e.g., Trivy, ClamAV, Docker Bench Security) configured to detect writable filesystem mappings in Docker Compose files must pass.\n2.  Regular manual/automated review of Docker Compose (`docker-compose.yml`) files to confirm all volume mappings adhere to the policy (read-mostly, necessary write access justified).\n3.  Periodic (e.g., quarterly) audits of user permissions on host systems relevant to Docker Compose operations.\n\n---"
