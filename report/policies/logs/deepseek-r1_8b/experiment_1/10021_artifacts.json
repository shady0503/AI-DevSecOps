  "response": "Okay, here is a security policy addressing the low-severity vulnerability ID 10021 with unknown affected components, mapped to NIST CSF 2.0 and ISO 27001:2022.\n\n---\n\n**Title:** Low - 10021 - Vulnerability Management Awareness and Secure Physical Handling (Adapted)\n\n**Scope:** All personnel, all organizational systems and data, including third-party environments accessed using organizational assets.\n\n**Risk:** Awareness of a potential vulnerability with unknown affected components and impact. Failure to manage associated risks (e.g., insecure handling of assets) could potentially exacerbate situations or lead to physical security breaches, impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\n\n**Controls:**\n*   **NIST CSF 2.0:**\n    *   **RS-DC-005 (Protect Data):** Protect confidentiality of data stored on computing components (NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 AC-17).\n    *   **RS-IR-010 (Respond to IR Events):** Respond to incident-related activities, including potential physical security incidents (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2-1.5).\n    *   **PR-DC-010 (Protect Data):** Protect confidentiality of data in transit (NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 AC-16).\n    *   **SP-007 (Mitigate Third-Party Risks):** Mitigate risks associated with third parties (ISO/IEC 27001:2022 A.10.1.4).\n*   **ISO 27001:2022:**\n    *   **Annex A 7.6 (A.11.1.5):** Working in secure areas.\n    *   **Annex A 7.7 (A.11.2.9):** Clear desk and clear screen practice.\n    *   **Annex A 7.8 (A.11.2.1):** Equipment screening and protection.\n    *   **Annex A 5.5 (A.6.1.3):** Contact with authorities (includes handling security alerts/requests).\n    *   **Annex A 5.8 (A.6.1.5):** Handling of security incidents.\n\n**Remediation:**\n1.  **Awareness Training:** Conduct mandatory annual training for all personnel on the existence of known vulnerabilities and the importance of secure practices (including handling equipment, data, and systems securely; adhering to clear desk policies; working within designated secure areas).\n2.  **Standard Secure Practices:** Reinforce standard operating procedures for physical security, including equipment screening upon entry/exit, clear desk procedures, and secure handling of sensitive materials/devices.\n3.  **Third-Party Interaction:** Ensure personnel handling interactions with third parties (e.g., maintenance, contractors) are aware of and adhere to organizational physical security policies.\n4.  **Incident Handling:** Ensure incident response procedures include protocols for potential physical security incidents related to vulnerable assets.\n\nTimeline: Awareness training and standard operating procedures review must be completed within 30 days. Ongoing reinforcement and monitoring occur throughout the year.\n\n**Verification:**\n*   Document evidence of completed mandatory awareness training (signatures, completion records).\n*   Audit trails of access to secure areas (if applicable).\n*   Periodic (e.g., quarterly) audits of workstations/computer rooms for adherence to clear desk and secure area policies.\n*   Review incident logs for any physical security incidents and assess response effectiveness."
