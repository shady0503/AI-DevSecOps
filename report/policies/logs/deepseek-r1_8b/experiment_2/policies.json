Title:**\nMedium Severity Vulnerability Mitigation: Writable Filesystem Service (VULN ID: yaml.docker-compose.security.writable-filesystem-service)\n\n**2. Scope:**\nThis policy applies to all systems running Docker Compose configurations that include services identified by the vulnerability ID \"yaml.docker-compose.security.writable-filesystem-service\". It applies to system administrators, developers, DevOps engineers, and security personnel responsible for managing these environments.\n\n**3. Risk:**\nThis vulnerability allows potential unauthorized modification of files on the host system by services running in a writable filesystem mode (e.g., volume bind mounts with write permissions). While the initial CVSS score indicates no specific impact, exploitation could lead to data tampering, unauthorized configuration changes, malware introduction, or escalation of privileges, posing a medium threat to system integrity and availability.\n\n**4. Controls:**\n\n*   **NIST CSF 2.0 - PR.PP-1 (Principle of Least Privilege):** Ensure services running in writable filesystem modes (e.g., Docker volumes) operate with the minimum necessary privileges. This restricts what the service can modify, preventing unauthorized changes to critical system or data files.\n*   **ISO 27001:2022 - A.9.4.2 (Secure Authentication/Authorization):** Implement strict access controls and authorization mechanisms for any filesystems exposed to services identified as writable. Ensure only authorized services and users have write access to specific directories or files, and enforce these permissions rigorously.\n\n**5. Remediation:**\n\n1.  **Identify and Remediate Writable Services (High Urgency - 7 days):** System administrators must immediately scan all relevant systems (as per scope) using automated tools (e.g., trivy, clamAV, custom scripts) to identify instances matching the vulnerability ID. For each identified instance, determine if the writable filesystem is essential for the service's operation. If not, change the Docker Compose configuration to use read-only volumes or properly isolated storage. If essential, implement strict containment (see Control 4).\n2.  **Restrict Writable Access (Medium Urgency - 14 days):** For services that *require* write access (if identified in Step 1), implement stricter filesystem permissions (e.g., chown, chmod) on the host filesystem to limit the service's ability to modify files. Ensure the service runs with a dedicated, non-privileged user ID mapping (UID mapping) in the Docker configuration. Review and tighten host system's filesystem permissions for all directories used as writable volumes.\n3.  **Enable Logging and Monitoring (Standard Urgency - 21 days):** Ensure all filesystem modifications on the relevant volumes are logged (e.g., using auditd on Linux hosts). Implement monitoring of these logs to detect unauthorized changes or suspicious activity related to the writable filesystems.\n\n**6. Verification:**\nRemediation effectiveness will be verified through:\n*   Regular scanning (e.g., weekly) using vulnerability scanning tools configured for Docker environments to confirm the absence of the specific vulnerability.\n*   Automated log analysis to detect any unauthorized modifications to the protected filesystems.\n*   Manual review of Docker Compose configurations and host filesystem permissions for compliance with the policy requirements.\n\n**7.
