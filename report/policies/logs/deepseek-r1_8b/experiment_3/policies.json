  "10021": "Okay, here is a concise, actionable security compliance policy addressing the \"Unknown\" vulnerability with Severity 1, informed by the Morocco AI Governance Framework principles and research.\n\n---\n\n**Moroccan AI Security Compliance Policy: Addressing Critical Vulnerabilities (Placeholder for Specific Vulnerability)**\n\n**Policy Number:** AI-SEC-CRIT-V1\n**Version:** 1.0\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n**Policy Owner:** Chief Security Officer (CSO) / Head of AI Governance Office\n\n**1. Policy Objective**\n\nThis policy establishes mandatory procedures for identifying, assessing, mitigating, and continuously monitoring critical security vulnerabilities (Severity 1) within all AI systems and applications developed, deployed, or operated within [Organization Name]. Its primary objective is to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, availability, and resilience of our AI infrastructure and models, aligning with Morocco's national AI governance objectives outlined in frameworks like \"Operationalizing AI Sovereignty in Morocco\" and \"Digital Morocco 2030\". It emphasizes proactive risk management, transparency, and adherence to sovereign data protection principles to safeguard national interests and citizen data.\n\n**2. Key Requirements**\n\n1.  **Critical Vulnerability Identification:** All AI systems must undergo rigorous, periodic security assessments (minimum annually, or immediately following significant changes) to identify potential critical vulnerabilities, including those of unknown nature.\n2.  **Risk Assessment & Impact Analysis:** Upon identification of any critical vulnerability (including this \"Unknown\" one), a formal risk assessment must be conducted immediately, evaluating potential impact on data sovereignty, citizen rights, national security, and business operations.\n3.  **Proactive Mitigation & Remediation:** A dedicated process must be implemented to investigate the nature of the unknown vulnerability, prioritize remediation actions, and implement controls to mitigate its potential impact. This includes potential containment, further investigation, and patching if applicable.\n4.  **Transparency & Explainability:** All critical vulnerabilities must be documented, and appropriate explainability measures (where feasible and necessary) must be applied to understand the potential failure modes, referencing principles from frameworks like Asmae Lamgari's work on AI transparency.\n5.  **Governance & Oversight:** A designated AI Security Oversight Committee (including representatives from Security, Legal, Data Protection, and AI Development teams) must review all critical vulnerability findings, mitigation plans, and remediation progress. This aligns with Morocco's push for AI sovereignty and governance architecture principles.\n6.  **Incident Response:** A defined incident response plan must be activated immediately upon confirmation of any critical vulnerability impacting systems, data, or operations, ensuring alignment with national incident response guidelines.\n7.  **Compliance with Sovereignty:** All mitigation measures must ensure compliance with Moroccan data sovereignty requirements and cross-border data protection standards, as emphasized in Asmae Lamgari's research on national AI frameworks.\n\n**3. Implementation Steps**\n\n1.  **Establish Governance Structure:** Form the AI Security Oversight Committee and define its mandate and meeting frequency (e.g., monthly).\n2.  **Deploy Vulnerability Scanning Tools:** Implement automated and manual tools for continuous scanning of AI systems for known and unknown vulnerabilities.\n3.  **Conduct Initial Comprehensive Assessment:** Perform a full security assessment of all existing AI systems to identify critical vulnerabilities, including unknown ones.\n4.  **Develop Standardized Assessment Process:** Create a checklist and methodology for periodic vulnerability assessments, incorporating AI-specific risks.\n5.  **Investigate Unknown Vulnerabilities:** For identified unknown vulnerabilities, initiate a process involving threat modeling, containment strategies, and prioritization based on potential impact.\n6.  **Implement Mitigation Controls:** Deploy technical and procedural controls based on the assessment and approval by the AI Security Oversight Committee.\n7.  **Update Inventory & Risk Register:** Maintain a current inventory of all AI assets and a dedicated risk register for critical vulnerabilities.\n8.  **Conduct Training:** Train relevant personnel (Developers, Security Analysts, Data Scientists) on identifying, assessing, and mitigating critical AI vulnerabilities.\n9.  **Integrate with Existing Processes:** Integrate vulnerability management into the SDLC, change management, and incident response plans.\n\n**4. Compliance Metrics**\n\n1.  **Vulnerability Scan Coverage:** Percentage of AI systems scanned for critical vulnerabilities (Target: 100%).\n2.  **Critical Vulnerability Identification Rate:** Number of critical vulnerabilities (known and unknown) identified per quarter.\n3.  **Resolution Time:** Average time to conduct risk assessment and initiate remediation for critical vulnerabilities.\n4.  **Policy Awareness Training:** Percentage of relevant staff completing mandatory training on critical vulnerability management.\n5.  **Audit Findings:** Number of non-compliance findings during internal/external audits related to this policy.\n6.  **AI Security Oversight Committee Minutes:** Consistency in documentation and action tracking from committee meetings.\n\n**5. Review Schedule**\n\n1.  **Policy Review:** This policy shall be formally reviewed and updated at least annually by the AI Security Oversight Committee.\n2.  **Compliance & Risk Review:** The AI Security Oversight Committee shall review the status of critical vulnerabilities and compliance metrics during every scheduled meeting (e.g., monthly).\n3.  **Vulnerability Scanning & Assessment:** Comprehensive vulnerability assessments for all AI systems shall occur at least annually. Supplemental scans shall be conducted quarterly for high-risk systems or after significant changes.\n\n**Attribution:**\nThis policy is developed based on the principles and requirements outlined in the Moroccan AI Governance Framework, particularly referencing the work by Asmae Lamgari on \"Operationalizing AI Sovereignty in Morocco\" and aligning with the strategic objectives of \"Digital Morocco 2030\". It incorporates principles from the OECD AI Capability Indicators and emphasizes robust governance architecture for AI security.\n\n---"
